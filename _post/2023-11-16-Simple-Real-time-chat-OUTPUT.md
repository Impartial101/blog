# Background

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to create a simple real-time chat application using Python and Tkinter. The application will use the Socket API to enable communication between a server and multiple clients.

## Socket API Overview

The Socket API provides a set of functions to establish communication channels between programs over a network. In this tutorial, we'll focus on TCP sockets for their reliability and simplicity.

# TCP Sockets

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data transmission. We'll use TCP sockets to implement our real-time chat.

## Echo Client and Server

Let's start by creating a basic Echo Server and Echo Client to understand the fundamentals of socket communication.

### Echo Server

```python
# Insert code for Echo Server
